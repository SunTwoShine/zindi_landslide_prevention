# Zindi Landslide Prevention and Innovation Challenge

The code shown in this repo is my solution to the 
[Zindi Challenge on landslide prevention](https://zindi.africa/competitions/landslide-prevention-and-innovation-challenge/).

The Challenge includes high-resolution terrain information from Hong Kong. The goal is to identify if a landslide occured at the location or not.

## Notebooks
The notebook EDA.ipynb includes the description of the data and some analysis. Notebook model.ipynb includes some data preparation, several models and their results. 
The models are used to predict whether a landslide occured in that specific location.
**My solution reached rank 19/172.**
